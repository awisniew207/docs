### `error` is now `runtimeError` and can only be set by `throw ...`

- Previously, if you had not defined a `deny` or `fail` schema, you could call `deny()` or `fail()` with a string
- That string would end up in the tool/policy response as the `error` property instead of `result`
- This was problematic because there was no consistent way to identify _un-handled_ error vs. _explicitly returned fail/deny results_
- If you don't define a deny or fail schema, you can no longer call those methods with a string.
- `error` is now `runtimeError`, and is _only_ set if a lifecycle method `throw`s an Error - in that case it will be the `message` property of the error
- If you want to be able to return simple errors in your _result_, you can define a simple deny or fail schema like `z.object({ error: z.string() }`
