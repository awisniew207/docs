/** The `jwt` module provides helper methods that allow you to decode and validate Vincent-specific JWTs.
 *
 * Vincent JWTs are signed using `alg: ES256K`.  The signed data is EIP191 compliant.
 *
 *
 * Vincent JWTs are issued by the Vincent Dashboard when a user provides delegation permission for your app to their agent PKP.
 * They are passed to your web app using a redirectUri which you configure on your app.
 *
 * The methods exported by the `jwt` module are low-level - you probably will just want to use {@link webAuthClient.getWebAuthClient | getWebAuthClient} to get
 * a {@link webAuthClient.WebAuthClient | WebAuthClient} which handles the redirect process, parsing the JWT from the URL, and verifying it for you.
 *
