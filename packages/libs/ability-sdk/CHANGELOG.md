## 2.1.0 (2025-09-11)

### 🚀 Features

- Refactor the Uniswap Swap Ability to utilize a prepare step which uses a Lit Action to generate and sign a Uniswap route generated by the V3 Alpha Router. The Swap Ability now intakes the signed route, validates it was signed by the expected PKP (which can only be used to sign the generated Uniswap routes within the prepare Lit Action), then uses the provided route to create and sign the Uniswap Swap transaction with the Agent Wallet PKP. The Uniswap Swap Ability was also updated to no longer support the Spending Limit Policy, and currently doesn't support any Policies.

## 2.0.1 (2025-09-03)

### 🧱 Updated Dependencies

- Updated contracts-sdk to 1.1.0

# 2.0.0 (2025-08-05)

### 🚀 Features

- Add descriptions on abilities and their api interface params ([0b8ff1e3](https://github.com/LIT-Protocol/Vincent/commit/0b8ff1e3))

### 🩹 Fixes

- Making api version property in bundled things to ease its discovery and usage when validating its compatibility ([aa81d087](https://github.com/LIT-Protocol/Vincent/commit/aa81d087))
- ### Implement supported Vincent Ability API range ([14f0ece1](https://github.com/LIT-Protocol/Vincent/commit/14f0ece1))

  Added basic Ability API handling to ensure abilities & policies are only used by compatible abilities and policies, and with the correct version of the vincentAbilityClient / app-sdk
  - Added a new jsParam when VincentAbilityClient calls an ability, `vincentAbilityApiVersion`
  - LIT action wrappers for abilities + policies compare `vincentAbilityApiVersion` to match the major semver range the handler was built with from the ability-sdk
  - vincentAbilityHandler() is responsible for passing along the value when it evaluates supported policies

### ⚠️ Breaking Changes

- Add support for vincent-contract-sdk using CBOR2 encoded policy parameters ([819fcd11](https://github.com/LIT-Protocol/Vincent/commit/819fcd11))
- ### `error` is now `runtimeError` and can only be set by `throw ...` ([04f1ca20](https://github.com/LIT-Protocol/Vincent/commit/04f1ca20))
  - Previously, if you had not defined a `deny` or `fail` schema, you could call `deny()` or `fail()` with a string
  - That string would end up in the ability/policy response as the `error` property instead of `result`
  - This was problematic because there was no consistent way to identify _un-handled_ error vs. _explicitly returned fail/deny results_
  - If you don't define a deny or fail schema, you can no longer call those methods with a string.
  - `error` is now `runtimeError`, and is _only_ set if a lifecycle method `throw`s an Error - in that case it will be the `message` property of the error
  - If you want to be able to return simple errors in your _result_, you can define a simple deny or fail schema like `z.object({ error: z.string() }`

- ### Add support for explicit `schemaValidationError` ([337a4bde](https://github.com/LIT-Protocol/Vincent/commit/337a4bde))
  - Previously, a failure to validate either input or results of lifecycle method would result in `result: { zodError }` being returned
  - Now, `result` will be `undefined` and there will be an explicit `schemaValidationError` in the result of the ability / policy

  ```typescript
  export interface SchemaValidationError {
    zodError: ZodError<unknown>; // The result of `zod.safeParse().error`
    phase: string; // Policies: `precheck`|`evaluate`|`commit` - Abilities: `precheck` | `execute`
    stage: string; // `input` | `output`
  }
  ```

## 1.0.2 (2025-07-08)

### 🩹 Fixes

- - Correct type of `PolicyEvaluationResultContext.deniedPolicy` so that `error` is a sibling of `result` ([edc609f5](https://github.com/LIT-Protocol/Vincent/commit/edc609f5))
- - Fixed a case where a deny response from a policy could be returned without being parsed by its deny result schema ([27a35240](https://github.com/LIT-Protocol/Vincent/commit/27a35240))
- - Fixed incorrect handling of failure results that resulted in `success: true` responses from abilities that returned fail results ([51087e71](https://github.com/LIT-Protocol/Vincent/commit/51087e71))
- - Fixed `undefined` being returned to caller instead of the correct `error` string in cases where no fail result schema was defined and an explicit string was passed to `fail()` ([e8f1316a](https://github.com/LIT-Protocol/Vincent/commit/e8f1316a))
- - Fixed ability result typeguard functions incorrectly returning `false` when they were provided outputs with no `result` (e.g. no return value schema is defined for the lifecycle method) ([cf542969](https://github.com/LIT-Protocol/Vincent/commit/cf542969))
