## 0.1.0 (2025-07-08)

### 🚀 Features

- - Implement policy failures e2e test suite ([64b736c8](https://github.com/LIT-Protocol/Vincent/commit/64b736c8))
- - Implement support for building and deploying fixture policies ([b98cbe16](https://github.com/LIT-Protocol/Vincent/commit/b98cbe16))
- #### Implement e2e test suite to verify result handling ([ac9f7138](https://github.com/LIT-Protocol/Vincent/commit/ac9f7138))

  - Implemented modified (parameterized) esbuild and deploy-to-ipfs scripts from our existing tools that will bundle and deploy all of the tools that are locally defined in the `toolpolicies-e2e` project
  - Defined E2E fixture tools for verifying fail and success behaviour of tools that are executed using the `VincentToolClient`.
  - Added `responseTests.spec.ts` file that runs `precheck()` and `execute()` for every fixture tool and verifies the results are the correct shape
  - Verifies both with and without schema cases with and without results, and case where an error is thrown from inside the lifecycle function
