# Contributing to Vincent Policy Spending Limit

This document provides guidelines for contributing to the Vincent Policy Spending Limit project.

## Overview

The Vincent Policy Spending Limit is a policy that can be attached to tools to avoid them spending more than a user-defined limit in a specific period of time. It's part of the Vincent Tools ecosystem and is built using the Vincent Tool SDK.

## Setup

1. Follow the global setup instructions in the repository root [CONTRIBUTING.md](../../../CONTRIBUTING.md).
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

## Development Workflow

### Building

Build the policy:
```bash
nx build vincent-policy-spending-limit
```

### Testing

Run tests:
```bash
nx test vincent-policy-spending-limit
```

## Project Structure

- `src/`: Source code
  - `index.ts`: Main entry point

## Policy Development Guidelines

1. Use the Vincent Tool SDK to create policies
2. Define clear schemas for tool parameters and user parameters
3. Implement the policy lifecycle methods (evaluate, commit)
4. Handle errors gracefully
5. Write comprehensive tests for all functionality
6. Document the policy's purpose and usage

## Integration with Tools

This policy can be integrated with various Vincent Tools to enforce spending limits. When developing or modifying the policy, consider how it will be used by tools such as:

- Vincent Tool ERC20 Approval
- Vincent Tool Uniswap Swap

## Testing

Write unit tests for all functionality:
```bash
pnpm test
```
