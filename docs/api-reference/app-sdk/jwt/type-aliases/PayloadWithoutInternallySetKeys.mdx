> **PayloadWithoutInternallySetKeys** = `DisallowKeys`\<`Record`\<`string`, `any`\>, [`InternallySetPayloadKeys`](./InternallySetPayloadKeys)\>

Defined in: [app-sdk/src/jwt/types.ts:37](https://github.com/LIT-Protocol/Vincent/blob/1ec4d670031700c70e1e2ba1640f87d4b5f07fe8/packages/libs/app-sdk/src/jwt/types.ts#L37)

Many standard payload properties are set automatically on Vincent JWTs, and will be overridden if you try to pass them
in the raw `payload` when creating a new JWT.

This interface identifies the keys that should not be provided in your `payload`, as they are internally managed.

See [InternallySetPayloadKeys](./InternallySetPayloadKeys) for the list.
