# Start Here

Vincent is an open-source framework powered by [Lit Protocol](https://litprotocol.com/) that empowers developers to create automated, user-controlled AI agents. With Vincent, you can build agents that automate the execution of operations across crypto networks, traditional finance (TradFi), and e-commerce platforms—all while ensuring users retain full control over their assets and data. Powered by Lit’s decentralized [key management network](https://developer.litprotocol.com/resources/how-it-works) and smart contracts, Vincent is your gateway to the future of the automated, User-Owned Web.

## Why Vincent?

Vincent optimizes for security, interoperability, and user-control to redefine how agents interact across Web3 and beyond:

- **Decentralized Key Management**: Vincent leverages Lit Protocol's [Programmable Key Pairs](https://developer.litprotocol.com/user-wallets/pkps/overview) (PKPs) to securely manage agent identities without exposing private keys.

- **Verifiable, Fine-Grained Policies**: Users have full control over the policies they set and can revoke them at any time. Policies are fine-grained to specific operations and verifiable on-chain.

- **Cross-Platform Automation**: With Vincent, agents can operate seamlessly across any blockchain or off-chain platform. Build agent-powered apps and tools for DeFi, TradFi, E-Commerce, and more.

- **Agent Marketplace**: Vincent will eventually serve as a marketplace for Vincent-powered apps and tools, enabling them to be discovered and interacted with by end users.

- **Open Source**: Fork, customize, and contribute to the [Vincent codebase](https://github.com/LIT-Protocol/Vincent) to shape the future of the agent-driven and user-controlled Web.
