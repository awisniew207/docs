  </p>
  <p>In this guide, you'll create and register your first Vincent App using the <a href="https://dashboard.heyvincent.ai/">Vincent App Dashboard</a>. You’ll select from existing Vincent Abilities and Policies, configure your App metadata, and register the App Delegatees whom are authorized to execute your App's Abilities.</p>
  <p>If you're unfamiliar with what a Vincent App is, checkout the <a href="./Getting-Started.md">Getting Started</a> guide to learn more.</p>
</div>

A Vincent App is composed of four key elements:

1. **Vincent Abilities**: Modular, executable functions that define the operations your App can perform on behalf of its Users.

- Abilities can interact with blockchains, APIs, databases, or any service reachable via JavaScript and HTTP requests.
- Each Ability is immutable once published and can only be executed under the conditions explicitly approved by the User ensuring transparent, tamper-proof behavior.

2. **Vincent Policies**: Programmable guardrails that govern when and how Vincent Abilities can be executed.

- Policies are immutable once published, and are configurable per User ensuring that every Ability execution is tightly scoped to each User’s explicit intent.

3. **Vincent App Delegatees**: Ethereum addresses authorized by your App to execute Abilities on behalf of Vincent Users.

4. **Vincent Agent Wallets**: Non-custodial wallets that enable secure, automated interactions between your Vincent App and its Users.

- Each Agent Wallet is powered by Lit Protocol's [Programmable Key Pairs (PKPs)](https://developer.litprotocol.com/user-wallets/pkps/overview), allowing Users to retain full control over their keys and assets while delegating narrowly scoped signing permissions specific to each Vincent Ability.

# Defining Your Vincent App

Before registering your Vincent App, you’ll need to decide on the core components that make up its behavior and the Policies your App Users will use to govern its execution.

# 1. Selecting Vincent Abilities

Vincent Abilities define the executable operations your App can perform on behalf of its Users such as swapping tokens, transferring assets, or querying APIs.

# 3. Registering Your Vincent App

<div class="box info-box">
  <p class="box-title info-box-title">
    <span class="box-icon info-icon">Info</span> Before registering your Vincent App
  </p>
  <p>Registering an App requires that you have tokens on Lit Protocol's Yellowstone blockchain to pay for gas. You can use <a href="https://chronicle-yellowstone-faucet.getlit.dev/">this faucet</a> to get the Lit test tokens used to pay for registering your App.</p>
</div>

Once you've selected your Vincent Abilities and Policies, you'll need to register your App using the [Vincent App Dashboard](https://dashboard.heyvincent.ai/).

> **Note:** When you register your App, you'll be creating the first App Version that Users can permit their delegation for. App Versions are immutable meaning you can't change the Abilities or Policies associated with an App Version once it's been published.
>
> To make changes to the Abilities and Policies your App uses, you'll need to create a new App Version. Learn more about App Versioning in [this guide](./Upgrading-Apps.md#how-app-versioning-works).

## Connecting your App Management Wallet to the App Dashboard

Before you can register your App, you'll need to connect an Ethereum wallet to the App Dashboard.

This wallet will be the Vincent App Manager for your new App and is responsible for creating new App Versions, defining which Vincent Abilities and Policies are used in each App Version, as well as the managing the App Delegatees that are permitted to execute Abilities on behalf of your App's Vincent Users.

![Connect App Management Wallet](../images/connect-app-management-wallet.png)

## Creating your App

After connecting your Vincent App Manager wallet to the App Dashboard, you can create a new App by clicking on the `Create New App` button which will take you to the following screen:

![Create New App](../images/create-new-app.png)

On this screen you'll need to define the following:

### Application Name & Description

This is the name of your App that will be used to identify your App within the Vincent ecosystem, and the description used to detail what your App is offering to do on behalf of its Users.

It's also displayed to the Vincent User when they are interacting with the Vincent Consent page to permit delegation to your App and configure their Policy parameters.

In this example image, `Automated Memecoin Dollar-Cost-Averaging` is the name of the Vincent App, and `This demo agent automatically identifies and purchases the top-performing Base memecoin on your predefined schedule.` is the description of the App:

![Consent UI](../images/consent-ui.png)

### App Mode

Defines the current deployment status of your App.

This setting will be used to filter the Apps displayed in the Vincent App Registry, so that `DEV` and `TEST` Apps are not displayed to Vincent Users when looking at the Registry. Use:

- `DEV` If you're currently developing the Vincent App and it's not ready to be used by your Vincent Users
- `TEST` If you're currently testing the Vincent App with your Vincent Users, and want to make the distinction that your App is not yet ready for production
- `PROD` If you've finished development and your App is ready to be used by your Vincent Users

### Authorized Redirect URIs

This is a list of URLs that are authorized to receive the Json Web Token (JWT) from the Vincent Consent page.

After Vincent Users have permitted delegation to your App, or are logging back into your App using Vincent, these redirect URIs are the only valid locations they can be redirected to from the Vincent Consent page back to your App.

Included in the URL parameters of the redirect URI is a Json Web Token (JWT) that is given to your App to identify the Vincent User and the App Version they've authorized. This allows you to know which Vincent Abilities and Policies the User has permitted your App to execute on their behalf.

### Abilities

This section is where you'll define the IPFS CIDs of each Vincent Ability that will be used in your App. You can copy and paste the IPFS CID of each Ability you'd like your App to use into this section.

For the available Abilities, see the [Selecting Vincent Abilities](#1-selecting-vincent-abilitys) section which contains links to the IPFS CIDs for each Ability, or use the IPFS CID of any custom Ability you've developed.

> **Note:** The [Creating a Vincent Ability](../Ability-Developers/Creating-Abilities.md) guide contains instructions for how to create your own Vincent Abilities to perform any on or off-chain action your Vincent App needs.

#### Policies

Each Vincent Ability has a list of supported Vincent Policies that can govern the execution of the Ability. It's up to you to select which Policies your Users can configure for each Ability your App uses.

You can add Policies for each Ability by clicking the `Add Policy` button and copy and pasting the IPFS CID of each Policy.

For the Abilities mentioned in the [Selecting Vincent Abilities](#1-selecting-vincent-abilitys) section, the following Policies are supported:

| Ability                                                                                                        | Supported Policies                                                                                            | Policy IPFS CID                                                                                                                          |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [ERC20 Token Approval](https://github.com/LIT-Protocol/Vincent/tree/main/packages/apps/ability-erc20-approval) | None                                                                                                          | -                                                                                                                                        |
| [Uniswap Swap Ability](https://github.com/LIT-Protocol/Vincent/tree/main/packages/apps/ability-uniswap-swap)   | [Daily Spending Limit](https://github.com/LIT-Protocol/Vincent/tree/main/packages/apps/policy-spending-limit) | [Link](https://github.com/LIT-Protocol/Vincent/blob/main/packages/apps/policy-spending-limit/src/generated/vincent-policy-metadata.json) |

#### Policy Parameters

Each Policy has parameters that can be configured by the Vincent User to explicitly define the conditions under which the Ability can be executed.

This section is where you'll define the parameters Users can configure for each Ability Policy.

Each Policy has a parameter name and type, where the name and type of each parameter must match what the Policy is expecting.

For the Policies mentioned in the [Selecting Vincent Policies](#2-selecting-vincent-policies) section, the following parameters are supported:

| Policy                                                                                                        | Parameter Name                    | Parameter Type |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | -------------- |
| [Daily Spending Limit](https://github.com/LIT-Protocol/Vincent/tree/main/packages/apps/policy-spending-limit) | `maxDailySpendingLimitInUsdCents` | `uint256`      |

After defining the above details for your App, you can click on the `Submit Application` button to create your App. This will prompt you to sign a transaction using your App Management Wallet to register your App on-chain using the Lit Protocol [Chronicle Yellowstone blockchain](https://developer.litprotocol.com/connecting-to-a-lit-network/lit-blockchains/chronicle-yellowstone).

## Adding Delegatees to your App

In order to execute your App's Vincent Abilities, you'll need to register App Delegatees. These delegatees are defined as Ethereum addresses that are authorized by your App to execute the Abilities that Vincent Users have permitted for your App.

After creating your App, you'll be redirected to the dashboard overview screen. Click the box with the name of the App you just created, and you'll be taken to the App's settings screen.

Next click the `Manage Delegatees` button to add the App Delegatees you'd like to authorize to execute your App's Vincent Abilities:

![Manage Delegatees](../images/vincent-app-manage-delegatees.png)

You will now be given two buttons:

- `Generate Delegatee` - This will generate a new Ethereum wallet giving you the private key and Ethereum address of the new wallet
  - Use this option if you don't have an existing wallet you'd like to use as an App Delegatee
- `Add Delegatee` - This will prompt you to provide the Ethereum address of an existing wallet you'd like to authorize as an App Delegatee

Whether you choose to generate a new wallet or add an existing wallet, you'll be prompted to sign a transaction using your App Management Wallet to register the App Delegatee on-chain using the Lit Protocol [Chronicle Yellowstone blockchain](https://developer.litprotocol.com/connecting-to-a-lit-network/lit-blockchains/chronicle-yellowstone).

## Generating Your App Link

At this point you have registered and configured your Vincent App, and it's ready to start having Vincent Users delegate to it.

In order to do this, User needs to have a link to the Vincent Consent page that has your App's metadata. This link can be generated for you by clicking the `Generate App URL` button on the App's settings screen:

![Generate App URL](../images/vincent-app-generate-app-url.png)

You will be prompted to select which Authorized Redirect URI (you configured in the [Creating your App](#creating-your-app) section) you'd like Users to be redirected to after they've permitted delegation to your App, or are logging back into your App using Vincent.

After selecting the Authorized Redirect URI, click on the `Copy Application URL` button to copy the link to the Vincent Consent page for your App to your clipboard. The link will look similar to:

```
https://dashboard.heyvincent.ai/appId/526/consent?redirectUri=https%3A%2F%2Fyour-redirect-uri.com
```

You can now share this link to allow Users to delegate the ability to execute your App's Vincent Abilities on their behalf.

# Wrapping Up

You’ve now learned how to create and register a Vincent App using the [Vincent App Dashboard](https://dashboard.heyvincent.ai/).

From selecting Abilities and Policies to configuring App metadata and adding Delegatees, you’ve completed the full setup process to launch your Vincent App and start executing Vincent Abilities on behalf of your Vincent Users.

Here’s a quick recap of what you covered:

- **Understanding the Core Concepts:** A Vincent App is composed of the following components that work together to enable trusted automation without sacrificing User control:
  - Vincent Abilities (what your App can do)
  - Vincent Policies (User defined guardrails)
  - App Delegatees (Ethereum addresses authorized to execute Abilities)
- **Selecting Vincent Abilities:** Choose from existing Abilities like ERC20 Approvals or Uniswap Swaps, or build your own Abilities to define the actions your App can perform on behalf of it's Users.
- **Selecting Vincent Policies:** Add programmable constraints to each Ability such as spending limits or token allowlists that ensure each execution respects the User’s intent.
- **Registering Your App:** Use the Vincent App Dashboard to define your App including details such as it's name, description, authorized redirect URIs, and the selected Abilities and Policies.
- **Adding Delegatees:** Specify the Ethereum addresses that will act on behalf of your Vincent App to execute Abilities Users have permitted.
- **Generating Your App Link:** Generate a Vincent Consent URL that lets Users delegatee access to their Vincent Agent Wallets, so that your App Delegatees can execute Abilities on their behalf.

## Next Steps

- If your App requires the ability to perform an action not offered by existing Vincent Abilities, checkout how to get started with [Creating a Vincent Ability](../Ability-Developers/Getting-Started.md) to learn how to perform any on or off-chain action your Vincent App needs.
- If the existing Vincent Policies don't meet your App's needs, checkout how to get started with [Creating a Vincent Policy](../Policy-Developers/Getting-Started.md) to learn how to create your own Vincent Policies to govern the execution of Vincent Abilities.
