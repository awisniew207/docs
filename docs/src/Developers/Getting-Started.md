# Getting Started as a Vincent Developer

There are different types of developers in the Vincent ecosystem depending on what you're building.

- Create and configure a Vincent App
- Install and use the Vincent App SDK to execute Vincent Tools governed by user-defined Vincent Policies<!-- TODO Link to SDK -->

## Tool Developers

Tool Developers create custom tools that enable Vincent Apps to perform specific actions on behalf of users.

[Get started with Tool Development](./Tool-Developers/Getting-Started.md) and learn how to:

- Install and use the [Vincent Tool SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@lit-protocol/vincent-tool-sdk) to define your custom tool logic
- Declare the Vincent Policies your tool supports
- Publish and register your tool for Vincent App developers to use

## Policy Developers

Policy Developers define rules that govern how and when Vincent Tools can be executed by Vincent Apps to execute actions on behalf of Vincent Users.
