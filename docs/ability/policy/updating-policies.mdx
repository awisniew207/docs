## FAQ

  <Accordion title="What if version creation failed?" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    If your policy version creation fails, try these solutions:

    - **Check npm publication**: Make sure the policy version is published on npm and publicly accessible
    - **Verify policy setup**: Ensure the policy is published properly with all required metadata
    - **Review implementation**: Check that your policy follows the correct structure and conventions

    For detailed guidance on setting up policies correctly, see our [Policy Quick Start guide](/ability/policy/quickstart).
