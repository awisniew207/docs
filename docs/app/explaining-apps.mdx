Understanding how Vincent Apps work is essential for building secure, user-controlled automation. This guide explains the key components and their relationships.

## Vincent Apps

Vincent Apps enable automated execution of on-chain and off-chain actions on behalf of users while maintaining strict user control through programmable permissions.

<ParamField path="appId" type="number">
  Unique identifier for your Vincent App across all versions
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="version" type="number">
  Immutable version number ensuring users know exactly what they've authorized
</ParamField>

 The core execution logic of Apps is composed of Vincent Abilities and Vincent Policies working together.

### Vincent Abilities

Modular, executable functions that define what your App can do. Each Ability is an `npm` package containing the logic for specific actions.

### Vincent Policies

Programmable guardrails that users configure to control how Abilities execute. Each Policy is an `npm` package that defines specific constraints and boundaries.

#### Version Immutability

App versions are immutable once published to ensure trust and transparency. Users delegate to a specific version with a fixed set of Abilities and Policies that cannot be changed without their explicit consent.

<Info>
When you need to modify Abilities or Policies, you must create a new version. See [Updating Your App](/app/updating-apps) for details on versioning and what requires a new version.

### App Delegatees

Ethereum addresses authorized to execute Abilities on behalf of users. These addresses act as the operational layer of your App.
