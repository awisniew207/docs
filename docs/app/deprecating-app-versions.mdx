title: Deprecating App Versions
---

After publishing new App Versions and updating the App's active Version, you may want to disable previous App Versions to encourage your Vincent App Users to upgrade to newer versions.

## Enable/Disable App Versions

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Version Dashboard">
    Click the version number menu item in the sidebar menu to access the specific App Version's dashboard.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Disable the Version">
    Click the **Disable App Version** button to deactivate the selected version.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
The **Disable App Version** button can be found on each App Version's dashboard page.
</Info>

### Effects of Disabling

Clicking this button will:

- Immediately disable the App Version in the Vincent App Registry
- Prevent your Vincent App Delegatees from executing Vincent Abilities for any Users who have authorized only the disabled App Version
- Next time they authenticate to your app, users will be prompted to upgrade to the latest enabled App Version to continue using your App

Once an App Version is disabled, the button will change to **Enable App Version**. Clicking this will re-enable the App Version, allowing your Vincent App Users who are still on that version to use it again, and permitting your Vincent App Delegatees to execute Vincent Abilities for that version.

## What Do Your Vincent App Users See When Changing App Versions?

If you create a new App Version and don't publish it, or create one and publish it, your Vincent App Users will not be notified of the new version.

<Note>
Users are only notified of new versions when you set the new version as your Vincent App's currently active App Version.
</Note>

### User Experience with Version Changes

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Both Versions Enabled">
    When both the user's current version and the app's active version are enabled:

    <img height="300" src="/images/app/deprecating/both-enabled.png" alt="Both Versions Enabled" />

    **User experience:**
    - They see a notification about the new version available
    - They can choose to upgrade or continue using their current version
    - No interruption to their workflow

    <Info>
    Users with enabled versions are not forced to upgrade and can continue using the version they've already permitted.
    </Info>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Current Version Disabled">
    When the user's current version is disabled but a new active version is available:

    <img height="300" src="/images/app/deprecating/current-disabled.png" alt="Current Version Disabled" />

    **User experience:**
    - They receive a prompt to upgrade to the latest enabled version
    - They must upgrade to continue using your App
    - They cannot access the App until they complete the upgrade

    <Warning>
    Disabling a version immediately blocks access for all users on that version until they upgrade.
    </Warning>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Both Versions Disabled">
    When both the user's current version and the app's active version are disabled:

    <img height="300" src="/images/app/deprecating/both-disabled.png" alt="Both Versions Disabled" />

    **User experience:**
    - They cannot access the App at all
    - No enabled version is available for them to upgrade to
    - You must re-enable at least one version for users to regain access

    <Warning>
    Ensure at least one version remains enabled to maintain user access to your App.
    </Warning>
  </Tab>
