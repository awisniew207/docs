Vincent Abilities define exactly what apps can do with your wallet. These building blocks enable secure delegation of specific permissions—from DeFi automation to cross-chain transfers—giving you granular control over each app's capabilities.

## Key Features

- **Flexible Data Access:** Read and write on-chain and off-chain data across any network
- **Policy-Driven Execution:** Execute abilities only when permitted by user policies
- **Cryptographic Capabilities:** Sign transactions and encrypt data with conditional access
- **Type-Safe Development:** Strongly-typed schemas ensure parameter validation and clear interfaces between Abilities and Policies
