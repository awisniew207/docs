## What makes Vincent different?

- **Decentralized Key Management:** Vincent leverages Lit Protocol's [Programmable Key Pairs](https://developer.litprotocol.com/user-wallets/pkps/overview) (PKPs) to securely manage agent identities without the possibility of ever exposing private keys.

- **Verifiable, Fine-Grained Policies:** Users have full control over the policies they set and can revoke them at any time. Policies are fine-grained to specific operations and verifiable on-chain.

- **Cross-Platform Automation:** With Vincent, agents can operate seamlessly across any blockchain or off-chain platform. Build agent-powered apps and abilities for DeFi, TradFi, E-Commerce, and more.

- **Agent Marketplace:** Vincent will eventually serve as a marketplace for Vincent-powered apps and abilities, enabling them to be discovered and interacted with by end users.

- **Open Source:** Fork, customize, and contribute to the Vincent codebase to shape the future of the agent-driven and user-controlled Web.
