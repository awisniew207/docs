Vincent Wallets are managed by [Lit Protocol's](https://litprotocol.com) decentralized key management network. Secured by Multi-Party Computation with Threshold Signature Scheme (MPC-TSS) and Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs), Lit ensures that all key material remains non-custodial, confidential, and fully in your control.

### **Multi-Party Computation Threshold Signature Scheme (MPC-TSS)**
- **Keys never exist in entirety:** Split across multiple nodes for security
- **No single point of failure:** Distributed architecture prevents compromise
- **Cryptographically secure:** Mathematical guarantees of key safety
- **Hardware protected:** Sealed environments prevent extraction

### **Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs)**
- **Complete isolation:** Separated from host systems and operators
- **Hardware encryption:** Built-in cryptographic protections
- **Tamper resistant:** Physical and software attack prevention
- **Zero exposure:** Keys never visible to anyone

### **Permission Enforcement via Lit Actions**
- **Enforce policies:** User-defined rules are cryptographically enforced
- **Access any data source:** Connect to blockchains and off-chain APIs
- **Remain verifiable:** All executions are cryptographically provable
- **Work everywhere:** Blockchain agnostic design supports any platform
