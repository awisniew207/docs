Vincent Wallets are non-custodial, cross-chain wallets powered by [Lit Protocol's](https://litprotocol.com) [Programmable Key Pairs (PKPs)](https://developer.litprotocol.com/user-wallets/pkps/overview) and secured by their decentralized key management network. They enable users to safely delegate transaction signing to Vincent Apps while maintaining full control over their assets through policy-governed delegation.

## Key Features

- **Non-Custodial Security:** Keys never exist in entirety, split across multiple nodes for security
- **Cross-Chain Support:** Works seamlessly across Solana, EVM chains, and Bitcoin
- **Policy-Governed Access:** Delegate signing permissions within user-defined boundaries
- **MPC-TEE Protection:** Advanced cryptographic security through distributed key management
