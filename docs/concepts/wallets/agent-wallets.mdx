Agent Wallets handle all delegation for specific Vincent Apps. Each Agent Wallet has a one-to-one relationship with a Vincent App and maintains persistent identity even when permissions are revoked and re-granted.

## Key Features

- **One-to-One Relationship:** Each Agent Wallet is dedicated to a single Vincent App
- **Persistent Identity:** Agent Wallets maintain the same identity even if permissions are revoked and re-granted
- **Isolated Operations:** Each app operates through its own dedicated Agent Wallet
- **Owned by User Account:** All Agent Wallets are owned and controlled by your User Account

## How Agent Wallets Work

1. **A new Agent Wallet is minted** when you first authorize a Vincent App, creating an isolated security boundary for that specific application.
2. **The Agent Wallet signs delegation permissions**, specifying which abilities the app can exerciseâ€”including code execution and signing operations on the wallet's behalf.
3. **The Agent Wallet records the authorization on-chain**, creating an immutable record of the permission grant and completing the delegation process.
