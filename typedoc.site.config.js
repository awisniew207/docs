// This config is used to drive generation of our complete typedoc site, including our 'documents' md files
// and the typedocs for each SDK/package in the repo.

// By composing JSON entrypoints inside the sub-packages, we can control when changes to the package docs
// are pushed to the live site.  We _usually_ only re-generate those JSON files when publishing to NPM.

// Unfortunately, you can't use watch mode on JSON entrypoints in the root of the repo, so each
// package has its own watch w/ HTML output that is .gitignored for local development iteration
